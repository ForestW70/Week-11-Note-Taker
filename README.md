  - found a lot of fun solutions to my problems in this project. having front end build already was nice, but of course couldnt help modifying some things. 

  - I did notice there wasnt a feature to modify notes so I thought it would be interesting to try and get that functionallity, since this is an app I could really use.

  - Big title. Big title.
